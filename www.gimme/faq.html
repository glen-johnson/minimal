           <h3 class="tos-about"> about Searching</h3>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. I want more results!</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Describing a product is not the same as asking Google or Siri a question!</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">Adjectives may have many synonyms and your search will only find websites that use the same synonyms you are using.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">We require product descriptions to be 3 words or less to capture the best stores competing for your business.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">&#8226; Instead of 'flea treatments, try just 'fleas'.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">&#8226; Instead of 'larimar necklace', try just 'larimar'.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">&#8226; Instead of 'honda accord seat covers', try 'honda seat covers'.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">&#8226; Try product synonyms: search both 'apple cases' and 'iphone folio'.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">&#8226; Compound words with spaces can bring up more results: search both 'shopvac' and 'shop vac.'</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">BTW, these suggestions will give you better shopping results on any search engine!</p>
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. The Highlight button appears to not do anything. Why?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">It takes a few seconds for your device to find and highlight your search words. If there are no search words in the results, then it will appear to have done nothing.</p>
           <p class="tos-answer">Kindle Fires take an obsurd length of time to highlight, most other devices work quickly.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">3. Where do the 'More pages' links come from?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">These are additional links to some of the underlying pages of the website.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">4. Are my searches being recorded?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">No. There is no storage, analysis, or correlation of your search words, search history, store visits or IP address.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">5. How do I do local searches?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">GimmeUSA does not track or request your whereabouts using your device. Append the city to your search, e.g. &#39;real estate agents Peoria&#39;.</em></p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">6. Does clicking on a website link incur a cost to the website owner?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">No, GimmeUSA does not use Pay-per-Click.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">7. I see ads related to my search appearing in other websites I later visit after using GimmeUSA. Why?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">You have visited a site in the GimmeUSA search results that sold your IP address and what you are shopping for to a third party. GimmeUSA itself does not participate in such programs.</em></p>

           
           <h3 class="tos-about">about Small Businesses</h3>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. Where does GimmeUSA find small businesses?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Some businesses are entered by users like you and others are discovered by our web crawler.<br>
           To enter your business or any business into GimmeUSA, type the domain name like 'myFavoriteStore.com' into the search bar.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. Are these small businesses safe to buy from?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Phone the business if this is your first purchase and the cost is high. Use PayPal or a credit card.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">3. Why buy from a small business rather than Amazon?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Small businesses have customer support, product experts, a telephone and they answer it. Not so at Amazon.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">4. Amazon always ships fast. How do I know I will get the same service?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">If you want something in a hurry, call the business and ask if your item is in stock and to please ship it immediately.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">5. I had a bad experience with a partiular business. What can I do?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Send an email to support@gimmeusa.com. Include the website name and we will contact the business.</p>

           <h3 class="tos-about"> about GimmeUSA</h3>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. What is GimmeUSA?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">GimmeUSA is a search engine for both service businesses and e-commerce businesses.</p>
                      
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. Doesn't Google and Bing do this?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Of course, but GimmeUSA does not factor in popularity metrics, allowing less known businesses to be on the first page.</p>

           <h4 class="tos-question">3. If GimmeUSA is all about small business, why are Amazon and Google buttons on all search result pages?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">This feature makes the website much more useful. The more useful a website is, the more traffic it will get.<p>
           
    


           <hr>
           <h3 class="tos-about"> about websites and search hits</h3>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. Why doesn't the GimmeUSA crawler discover and index all my website's pages automatically?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">To prevent sites like Walmart.com and Amazon.com from dominating search results, GimmeUSA limits each website to 60 indexed pages.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. I have more than one page on my website that matches a product search but only see one page from my website in the search results. Why?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">To expose more businesses to more shoppers, each website is allowed one result page on any search. The page chosen has the best relevance to the search terms.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">3. How do I find what pages GimmeUSA has indexed for a particular website?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">On the search page, enter just the domain name, e.g. &#39;beachncreations.com&#39;.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">4. How can I prevent GimmeUSA from indexing my website?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Disallow &#39;/&#39; for User-Agent &#39;gimmeusa&#39; in your website's robots.txt file.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">5. How does GimmeUSA rank search results?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer"><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> is our search engine core. It is used unmodified. After Solr returns a set of search results, we boost the score of promoted websites because we know these websites are active and current.</p>
           
           
           
           <hr>
           <h3 class="tos-about"> about crawling and database updates</h3>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. I changed my website. When will GimmeUSA see my updates?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">The web crawler reads each website about once a week. Indexed pages will be updated then.</p>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. My website was rejected by GimmeUSA after I entered my domain name. What can I do?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">If the reason is fixable as indicated in the index results, please fix your website and enter the domain name again into the search bar. It will be re-examined and indexed if corrected.</p>

           <!--
           <h3 class="tos-about"> about Boosting</h3>
       
           <h4 class="tos-question">1. I boosted my website but still dont see it in search results. Why?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">Boosting is done after the search results are generated, so a webpage has to be in the top 300 search hits before it can be boosted. This is done so boosting does not affect search keyword relevence.</p>
           
           <h4 class="tos-question">2. I only see one page from my website being boosted. Why?</h4>
           <p class="tos-answer">For any search, GimmeUSA publishes one webpage from any website to keep sites like Amazon from dominating search results. A boosting subscription does not circumvent this rule.</p>
